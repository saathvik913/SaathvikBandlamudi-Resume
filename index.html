        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Saathvik Bandlamudi. I am a student at UCR who is majoring in business administration with a focus on Financial Advising. I plan to become a financial advisor regarding stocks, shares, ETFâ€™s, and bonds. So far the experience I have with this is my own personal trading of stocks in the stock market. I do research and find the best stocks to buy and sell to make short-term and long-term profits. I plan to utilize my expertise and research to become a financial advisor and help other people make money if they want to. I can help them make short-term money and even long-term money if they prefer that. I plan to get an internship at a major brokerage firm during my third year to become an intern and learn the professional side of things. I hope to make a lot of people money including myself.<br><br>

        The work experience I have had in the past is creating a club called Indian Domain and being the Vice President of it. The goal of the club was to gather people to talk about the problems India faces regarding the cast system, and lack of food and water supply. We raised a bit of money to donate to some orphanages as well in India. I also planned to visit India to help at some hospitals and schools, but unfortunately, COVID hit so I couldnâ€™t go visit due to travel restrictions. When travel restrictions ease up I plan to visit and help wherever it is needed. At one point the club had 60 members who would actively participate in discussions and debates regarding problems in India. These people were just as dedicated as me and we would try our best to see what we could do to help the problems in India as they were becoming increasingly worse.<br><br>

        In these next 3 years of college at UCR, I plan to finish all my lower degree class requirements and finish all my upper-division class requirements as well with a focus on financials so I can become a financial advisor and help me and people make money in the stock market. I plan to get an internship in the 3rd year so I can see how the professional side of financial advising is. Also to help me practice for that internship I will do research and provide friends and family with my advice to see how it goes and see if I can make them money to help myself prepare as a professional. I also plan to get my Master's In Business because I wanna learn as much as I can to make sure not to leave anything to waste. I will do this to become the financial advisor I could possibly become.
